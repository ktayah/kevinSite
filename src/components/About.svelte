      I love building software that is elegant, concise, and most importantly,
      gets the job done. In my past 3 years of experience, I have completed
      several projects, many in the MERN stack. I found myself wearing multiple
      hats to fulfill company needs; from scrum master to developer to potential
      employee recruiter. Sometimes, what keeps servers running is being more
      than a software developer, but an adaptable team member.
