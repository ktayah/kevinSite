    <p class="text header-text">about</p>
    <p class="text">I love building software that are elegant, concise, and most importantly, get the job done. In my past 3 years of experience, I have completed several projects, many in the MERN stack. I found myself wearing multiple hats to fulfill company needs; from scrum master to developer to potential employee recruiter. Sometimes, what keeps servers running is being more than a software developer, but an adaptable team member.</p>
