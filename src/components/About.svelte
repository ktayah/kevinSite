    <p class="text header-text">about</p>
    <p class="text">I love building software that are elegant, concise, and most importantly get the job done. In my past 3 years of experience, I worked on multiple projects, many in the MERN stack. I found myself wearing multiple hats to fulfill company needs, from scrum master to a developer to interviewing potential employees. Sometimes, more than just being a software developer, the need for adaptable team members is what keeps servers running.</p>
